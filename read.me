This repository contains data of a dialectometric research conducted among speakers of Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA) speakers of Urmiya, Krasnodar Krai, and some adjacent areas.
The data have been gathered using a questionnaire: a set of Russian sentences that we used in elicitation. The sentences were created with the idea that their translations should contain many variables that are known to distinguish between NENA dialects.
This repository contains three files.
- "Variables" contains the 67 variables as they were represented in the 17 sentences in the questionnaire together with some additional information on this variables.
- "Speakers" is an anonymized list of speakers who took part in the elicitation work together with their year of birth, dialect self-identification and other metalinguistic data.
- "Data" is the main spreadsheet where individual responses obtained from the speakers are annotated as representing one of the few discrete pre-conceived possible values of the variables.
